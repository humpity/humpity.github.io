Bottom popup Menu.

I've been building a widgets framework, (incomplete),
but couldn't help to first share this latest widget, which is
a six pane popup menu which slides out from the bottom. Those that
are used to android must have at some time seen something similar
in other non-rfo apps.

What's 'special' about this particular widget is that it uses a
new technique of sliding the widget by piggybacking on top of a
bitmap. As some coders have found out on this forum, moving a 
single bitmap is faster and smoother than moving individual objects.
It also reduces code since there's only one object to move.

The technique is simple;
Create a bitmap.
Draw your objects on the bitmap using Gr.bitmap.drawinto.start/end.
Move/animate the bitmap instead of the objects.

The downside of course is that your objects are not on the display list.
If you need to preserve objects, then you can draw a duplicate set of your objects but hide them during the bitmap animation. And then show
them after.


Although faster than object moving, pixel by pixel movement of the bitmap itself is not exactly fast,but speed can be gained by jumping pixels and the stepping effect is plausable/negligable even when skipping up to 10 pixels. I have set the demo speed to 5 (you can change it in botmenu.bas). I found that cheap phones (unbranded) require speeds from 5 to 10 while the branded phones can have good affect with speeds as low as 3.
