RadarGhost is a ghost detector.

(ah.., ok maybe not, - yeah, you guessed it, it's a Basic version that looks
not unlike the 100s of other ghost radars that clog up playstore.

I dug out this old project and tried to revamp it. I remember I first gave up
because it wouldn't work on all my phones, only to find that the phones didn't
actually have the sensors(!). That and it was too slow. 
With the new phones these days, it performs a ok and I have tried to
make it work with old devices. 


..and now for the real reason for the post;
Of interest is the block at the bottom of the file misc.bas. Here you'll
see two functions 'with the same name'!, but only one of them gets used 
depending on the android version.

(p.s/ app will not work for some phones, don't be surprised)
