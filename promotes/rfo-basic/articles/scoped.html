          Here is a map of <A href="storage.html">Android

          It maps an overview of the different areas of storage

          <DIV style="margin-left: 40px;">
            For a long time now,&nbsp; many apps have used
            <SPAN style="text-decoration: underline;"><SPAN style=
            "color: rgb(0, 102, 0);">External</SPAN>

            (<SPAN style="font-weight: bold;">removable
            sdcard</SPAN>).<BR>
            <BR>
            Since Android 11, Google has been enforcing Scoped
            Storage.<BR>
            This forced developers to move their apps to<BR>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            Primary&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; External <SPAN style=
            "color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">Private</SPAN> storage
            <SPAN style="font-weight: bold;">(sdcard)</SPAN><BR>
            or<SPAN style="color: rgb(0, 102, 0);">&nbsp;</SPAN>
            Secondary External <SPAN style=
            "color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">Private</SPAN> storage
            (<SPAN style="font-weight: bold;">removable
            sdcard</SPAN>).<BR>
            i.e this is how apps can be scoped.<BR>
          </DIV><BR>
          <SPAN style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);"><FONT size=
          "+1"><A name="private" id="private"></A>What is Private
          storage ?</FONT></SPAN><BR>
          <DIV style="margin-left: 40px;">
            The word '<SPAN style=
            "color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">Private</SPAN>' has become
            synonymous with '<SPAN style=
            "color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">Scoped</SPAN>'.<BR>
            These are areas where nobody but your app can
            access.<BR>
            <SPAN style="text-decoration: underline;">Google wants
            each app to get <SPAN style=
            "font-weight: bold;">scoped,</SPAN> so that they cannot
            see each other.</SPAN><BR>
          </DIV><BR>
          <SPAN style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);"><FONT size=
          "+1"><A name="internal" id="internal"></A>What is
          Internal storage ?</FONT></SPAN><BR>
          <DIV style="margin-left: 40px;">
            There is also another area called <SPAN style=
            "text-decoration: underline;"><SPAN style=
            "color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">Internal</SPAN> Storage</SPAN>
            which a fewer number of apps use.<BR>
            This storage is also <SPAN style=
            "color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">Private</SPAN> and has been
            there since the beginning of Android.<BR>
            Not many apps used it because it was a small area
            (expensive in those days) and because they were
            'scoped' (i.e private).<BR>
            So most apps chose to use External instead where shared
            storage areas were more plentiful and easily shared
            between apps.<BR>
            <BR>
            The greatest confusion for users has been the
            difference between <SPAN style=
            "text-decoration: underline;">'Internal</SPAN> Storage'
            and <SPAN style=
            "text-decoration: underline;">'External</SPAN>
            storage'.<BR>
            <SPAN style="text-decoration: underline;">Modern phones
            emulate the primary sdcard using 'internal' storage,
            and this is where the word gets confused.</SPAN><BR>
            Even though an 'sdcard' uses 'internal' (fast) storage,
            it is still classified as 'External'.<BR>
            True Internal Storage, is not emulated, and has always
            been Private storage (not Shared).<BR>
            Any type of Private storage is also removed after the
            app is uninstalled.<BR>
          </DIV><BR>
          <SPAN style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);"><FONT size=
          "+1"><A name="shared" id="shared"></A>Google slowly
          killed off Shared storage<BR></FONT></SPAN>
          <DIV style="margin-left: 40px;">
            Shared storage are those areas where apps can see each
            other's files with read and write access.<BR>
            There are fewer areas where apps can freely share
            storage.<BR>
            Infact, according to the documentation apps are not
            even allowed to write to Download unless there is
            already a subdirectory waiting for it there.<BR>
            <BR>
            The official way to share storage is to use special
            APIs like File-Provider or Media Collections.<BR>
            These allow access '<SPAN style=
            "text-decoration: underline;">per file</SPAN>', they
            cannot share whole directories.<BR>
            And even then, there are rules to write-access
            depending whether it was your app that created the
            file.<BR>
            And you cannot access them via normal libraries. You
            have to send an intent..etc<BR>
            In short, they are a real pain to implement.<BR>
            <BR>
            Since Android 14, Google has tightened the screws, even
            file managers like Total Commander can only open scoped
            storage by opening Androids' internal file-manager, an
            independent app that is only single pane. You need a
            phone that can open two panes (split-screen) in order
            to copy files. Another way to gain access is via a
            permission broker e.g Shizuku.<BR>
            <BR>
            All apps that have been compiled for Android 11 and
            higher (Target API 30+) are forced to be scoped. Apps
            can no longer access areas outside of their own scoped
            storage.<BR>
            As a simple example;<BR>
            Where before we could open any .html file on your phone
            with a web browser and browse via a link to any other
            .html file in the same directory. You can no longer do
            this any more.<BR>
            The directory does not belong to the web browser
            app.<BR>
            Even if you properly shared the first .html file to the
            browser, the second file was not shared with the first
            file, so the second file cannot be accessed. In scoped
            storage, directories cannot be shared.<BR>
